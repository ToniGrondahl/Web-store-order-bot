# Web Store Order Bot Project

This project was made as part of an RPA course at Laurea University of Applied Sciences. 
The purpose and functionality of this robot is to make the order and checkout process in an online store faster and more convenient. It navigates to an online shopping website, adds the desired item to the cart, and fills out the necessary customer details and completes the checkout process.
